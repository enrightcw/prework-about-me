      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a Project Manager who is not great at talking about himself.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I've lived up and down the eastern seaboard, prior to here I'm from Massachusetts.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Wide and varied, I play video games to destress, and I'm slowly picking up golf.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Is being independently wealthy a dream job...?  I have less of a dream job, and more of 
        a dream environment meant, working with a creative team to conjure amazing things into 
        existence.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Bluffton, SC</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I learned BASIC in high school, and started my BA in CS, but it wasn't the right time in my life
        to focus on something like this.  I feel like the time is right now and I'm excited to get started.
